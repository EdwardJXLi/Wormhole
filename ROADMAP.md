# Wormhole Roadmap
Wormhole was originally a simple weekend project to consolidate everything I needed in real-time video streaming into one simple-to-use library. As the project grew, I saw how much potential it had to do much more as an all-in-one video, camera, and data streaming library for Python. That is why I divided Wormhole's development into five generations. 

- Generation One is all the essential features I need for a usable streaming library. This includes basic mjpeg and raw streams, but also basic protocol negotiations and a simple-to-use API. 
- Generation Two expands on gen one to make Wormhole a fully-fledged streaming library with all the convenience features I could need.
- Generation Three expands on gen two to support high bitrate streams, hopefully bringing real-time 4k60fps streams over the air. 
- Finally, Generation Four and beyond are all the visions I have to make Wormhole a fully-fledged video streaming library capable of emulating other tools like Zoom or Google Meet.

Of course, this project won't be done in just over a weekend or two. Wormhole's development will most likely last for years, adding incremental features whenever I feel it's missing. If you would like to help with this journey, feel free to submit a PR anytime. Nevertheless, the goals shown below are just preliminary plans, so if you feel like there is a feature that is missing, feel free to edit this list!
